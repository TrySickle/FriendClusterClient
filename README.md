# Friend Cluster Mobile Client

Written with React Native  
1. Change the server url since this was running on a local tunneled server
2. Look for all instances referring to ngrok, change the url to the FriendClusterServer url  

Note: geolocation is very bad with the current service  
Need to run the Friend Cluster Server as well with a MongoDB connection
